## Abstract 
  
Social media posts often reflect popular concepts in the world, which can represent themselves as hashtags or tags. Using the YouNiverse dataset, we will examine the characteristics of "trending" tags on YouTube, a platform where content creation is relatively more effortful. We want to examine the evolution of the use of trending tags and whether events in the world can influence the emergence and decline of tags. We also want to analyze if trending tags interact more with other tags with the help of graph networks. This analysis may also reveal cases of misuse. While some people use irrelevant trending hashtags to increase engagement for their posts, it causes a nuisance for other users who are looking for up-to-date information and news. Twitter is a platform facing this problem, with its rapid nature in spreading information. In this project, we investigate whether the YouTube community is facing the same issue.

## Research Question
The aim of this project is to investigate the following research questions:

* How do tags evolve and die? When do they start to appear as popular tags, do these coincide with emergence of real-life events? 
* How do clusters of tags that are used together behave temporally? Do trending tags get more importance in these clusters during their popularity?
* Do people misuse video tags on unrelated video categories to exploit trending topics?   

## Methods

### Dataset
#### Storage
We use Google Drive and Google Colab Pro for our analysis. While some categories can be handled without problem, others will be handled by reading chunk by chunk.

#### Pre-processing
Given we deal with tags, only initial pre-processing related to text is removing 

### Tag Graph Analysis
#### Tag Clustering
#### Centrality Analysis
#### 

### Visualisation

We plan to visualize the graph using one of the following libraries:
- [Cosmograph](https://cosmograph.app/)
- [sigma.js](https://www.sigmajs.org/)
While both libraries can be used, sigma has the advantage of better search and node specific visuals. However Cosmograph has better handle on bigger graphs. As we create graphs, we will choose the better one for our use case.

* Step 1: Data pre-processing
* Step 2: Initial analysis / EDA
Create a graph from tags, by connecting tags that were used together on a video.
Analyse the evolution of the graph.
We check if trend tags make more connections with tags that were not connected before the topic became trendy.
