# Tags on Trends

## Abstract 
The idea of the project is to understand the trajectories of tags: 
* (1) how tags evolve over the years and 
* (2) how events happening in the world can influence the appearance and decline of tags.  

Twitter is known as a good source of news for its rapid nature in spreading information. While using viral hashtags under various post can increase tweet engagements, it causes a nuisance for other users who are looking for up-to-date news regarding critical events and disasters, like the #richardsonwildfire, or ongoing sports events such as the #olympicsgame, for instance. In this project, we would investigate if the YouTube community is facing the same issue in the context of tags misuse. Whenever a youtuber misuses a tag, other users can flag the video. The youtuberâ€™s videos and channel can get shadowbanned if multiple flags are received. We can also use this information to determine if this is one of the factors where a famous channel experiences a rapid decline in their channel engagements due to tag misuse. 

## Research Question
The aim of this project is to investigate the following research questions:

* How do tags evolve and die? We can focus on one or few specific tags (that are relevant to our story) and study its trajectories. We can find out if a dying tag is replaced with a new term.
* How do clusters of tags behave temporally? We can use word clouds in specific intervals and relate them to real-life events during that period of time.
* Do people often misuse video tags on unrelated video categories to exploit trending topics? 

## Proposed additional datasets


## Methods
* Step 1: Data pre-processing
* Step 2: Initial analysis / EDA
Create a graph from tags, by connecting tags that were used together on a video.
Analyse the evolution of the graph.
We check if trend tags make more connections with tags that were not connected before the topic became trendy.
* Step 3: 
* Step 4:
